The vast supply chain network faces critical challenges in maintaining real-time visibility, efficiently managing resources and ensuring seamless operations across warehouses, distribution centres, and stores. Manual processes for tracking inventory, managing manpower, and coordinating logistics lead to inefficiencies, delays, and increased operational costs. 
To optimize these operations, there is a need for an integrated solution that provides comprehensive oversight, automates critical processes, and delivers actionable insights in real-time, ensuring that resources are utilized effectively. Operations run smoothly at every stage of the supply chain.

Eagle View:

In large distribution and fulfilment centres, it can take time to maintain real-time visibility of inventory and operations. Lack of oversight can lead to delays, misplaced items, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. Warehouse operations often need more real-time visibility, leading to bottlenecks, inefficient space utilization, and misplaced inventory. 

We have developed a solution that provides a comprehensive, real-time, bird's-eye view of the entire warehouse or distribution centre, allowing for better tracking of inventory and operational activities.

Check-in/Check-out using QR:

Manual tracking of goods and personnel within a warehouse leads to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. Traditional check-in/check-out processes are time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to inaccuracies in inventory tracking. High turnover and frequent warehouse personnel changes can lead to confusion and delays. 
 
We have implemented a QR-based check-in/check-out system to streamline and automate the process. This ensures accurate and real-time tracking of goods and workforce movements across the supply chain.

Dedicated Dashboard for Analysis:

Data silos within supply chain operations make it difficult to gain a holistic view of performance metrics. Decision-makers often need more timely access to critical data, leading to delayed responses to operational issues. 

We have created a dedicated dashboard that provides real-time revenue analysis, workforce metrics, and operational performance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly.

Report Generation:

Manual report generation can be time-consuming and prone to errors, delaying decision-making. 

Develop an automated report generation system that pulls data from various supply chain stages, providing accurate and timely reports on critical metrics such as inventory levels, transportation efficiency, and workforce productivity. A dynamic report generation system that allows users to customize reports based on selected parameters, providing insights tailored to specific challenges in the supply chain.

Manpower Management:

Efficiently managing a large workforce in a supply chain environment is challenging, especially when dealing with fluctuating demands and labour shortages. Manual workforce scheduling leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for optimizing labour costs. 

Design a manpower management system that optimizes the allocation of workers based on real-time data, ensuring that the correct number of personnel is available at the right time and place.

Parking Slot Management:

Inefficient parking slot management for trailers at warehouses can lead to congestion, delays in loading/unloading, and increased operational costs. Inefficient management of parking slots often leads to underutilization of available space. 

Implement a parking slot management system that optimizes trailer movements within the yard, reducing congestion and improving overall efficiency in the supply chain.

Notifications

In the fast-paced environment of supply chain operations, timely communication is critical to addressing issues and maintaining efficiency. In fast-paced supply chain environments, delays in communication can result in missed deadlines and increased costs.

Develop a notification system that sends real-time alerts to relevant personnel about crucial events, such as delays, inventory shortages, or operational disruptions, ensuring prompt action and minimizing downtime.
